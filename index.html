      A Chrome-Wrapping configuration tool for browsing I2P. The very simplest way to
      configure Chromium-based browsers to visit I2P sites, without interfering with
      your main browser configuration.
    </p>
    <p>
      It installs extensions in the browsing profile prior to launching it. Those are:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>
        I2P Chrome Configuration
      </li>
      <li>
        Ublock Origin
      </li>
      <li>
        ScriptSafe(Possibly redundant)
      </li>
      <li>
        LocalCDN
      </li>
      <li>
        Onion Browser
      </li>
    </ul>
    <p>
      They were picked for similarity with i2p.plugins.tor-manager’s extension loadout.
    </p>

      This is
      <strong>
        NOT FINISHED
      </strong>
      software, but it is usable and probably pretty good at
      what it’s supposed to do. It’s the only halfway decent way of configuring I2P with
      that miserable travesty Microsoft Edge for instance.
    </p>
    <p>
      Seriously can’t believe Microsoft is still trying to make a browser.
    </p>
    <p>
      It works by using the excellent
      <a href="https://github.com/zserge/lorca" rel="nofollow">
        Lorca
      </a>
      library
      created the same people who made the Webview bindings for Go as a means to wrap
      several variants of the Chrome browser in order to configure them to work with
      I2P. It does this using a different working area to your “main” Chrome browser,
      which prevents it from interfering with other ways you browse.
    </p>
    <p>
      It is not actually a Chromium fork. It’s just a wrapper around Chromium, in the
      same way that
      <code>
        i2p.firefox
      </code>
      is a wrapper around Firefox.
    </p>
    <p>
      Works pretty much anyplace you can shoehorn a Chromium somewhere on the
      <code>
        $PATH
      </code>
      .
